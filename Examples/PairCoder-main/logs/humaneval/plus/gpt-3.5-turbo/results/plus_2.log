Provide up to 3 possible solution plans to the problem.
Each solution plan should:
1.Have a descriptive name.
2.Outline the solution approach:
   - For simple problems (e.g., reversing a list), provide a concise solution (e.g., we can directly use list1[::-1] to do it.).
   - For complex problems (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph), provide a problem-solving plan with high-level steps (e.g., we can use BFS to solve it. First, Initialize a queue with... Second, ...).
  If necessary, select an appropriate algorithm through problem analysis such as brute force, simulation, greedy, hash map, two pointers, DFS/BFS, stack/queue, DP, etc.
