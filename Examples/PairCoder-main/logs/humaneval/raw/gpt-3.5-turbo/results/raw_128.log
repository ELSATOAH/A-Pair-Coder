  The problem requires calculating the sum of the magnitudes of integers in an array multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. The signs are represented by 1, -1, or 0. If the input array is empty, the function should return None.

tests_explanations:
- input: |
    [1, 2, 2, -4]
  output: |
    -9
  explanation: |
    The product of signs is -1 * 1 * 1 * -1 = -1. The sum of magnitudes is |1| + |2| + |2| + |-4| = 9. Multiplying the product of signs by the sum of magnitudes gives -1 * 9 = -9.

- input: |
    [0, 1]
  output: |
    0
  explanation: |
    The product of signs is 0 * 1 = 0. The sum of magnitudes is |0| + |1| = 1. Multiplying the product of signs by the sum of magnitudes gives 0 * 1 = 0.

Provide up to 3 possible solution plans to the problem.
Each solution plan should:
1.Have a descriptive name.
2.Outline the solution approach:
   - For simple problems (e.g., reversing a list), provide a concise solution (e.g., we can directly use list1[::-1] to do it.).
   - For complex problems (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph), provide a problem-solving plan with high-level steps (e.g., we can use BFS to solve it. First, Initialize a queue with... Second, ...).
  If necessary, select an appropriate algorithm through problem analysis such as brute force, simulation, greedy, hash map, two pointers, DFS/BFS, stack/queue, DP, etc.
3.Ensure functional correctness by addressing all possible valid inputs and edge cases per problem description.

You are given a coding problem:

def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """

Self-reflection on the problem:
- The problem requires calculating the sum of the magnitudes of integers in an array multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. The signs are represented by 1, -1, or 0. If the input array is empty, the function should return None.
Here are also explanations for public test cases:
- input: |
    [1, 2, 2, -4]
  output: |
    -9
  explanation: |
    The product of signs is -1 * 1 * 1 * -1 = -1. The sum of magnitudes is |1| + |2| + |2| + |-4| = 9. Multiplying the product of signs by the sum of magnitudes gives -1 * 9 = -9.

- input: |
    [0, 1]
  output: |
    0
  explanation: |
    The product of signs is 0 * 1 = 0. The sum of magnitudes is |0| + |1| = 1. Multiplying the product of signs by the sum of magnitudes gives 0 * 1 = 0.

- input: |
    []
  output: |
    null
  explanation: |
    The input array is empty, so the function should return None as specified in the problem description.

Provide up to 3 possible solution plans to the problem.
Each solution plan should:
1.Have a descriptive name.
2.Outline the solution approach:
   - For simple problems (e.g., reversing a list), provide a concise solution (e.g., we can directly use list1[::-1] to do it.).
   - For complex problems (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph), provide a problem-solving plan with high-level steps (e.g., we can use BFS to solve it. First, Initialize a queue with... Second, ...).
  If necessary, select an appropriate algorithm through problem analysis such as brute force, simulation, greedy, hash map, two pointers, DFS/BFS, stack/queue, DP, etc.
3.Ensure functional correctness by addressing all possible valid inputs and edge cases per problem description.

Your answer should be directly parsable as YAML. DO NOT output anything else.
The output must be a YAML object like this:
Example YAML output:
