Provide up to 3 possible solution plans to the problem.
Each solution plan should:
1.Have a descriptive name.
2.Outline the solution approach:
   - For simple problems (e.g., reversing a list), provide a concise solution (e.g., we can directly use list1[::-1] to do it.).
   - For complex problems (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph), provide a problem-solving plan with high-level steps (e.g., we can use BFS to solve it. First, Initialize a queue with... Second, ...).
  If necessary, select an appropriate algorithm through problem analysis such as brute force, simulation, greedy, hash map, two pointers, DFS/BFS, stack/queue, DP, etc.
3.Ensure functional correctness by addressing all possible valid inputs and edge cases per problem description.

You are given a coding problem:

def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """

Self-reflection on the problem:
- The problem requires sorting a given array based on whether the sum of the first and last elements is odd or even. If odd, sort in ascending order; if even, sort in descending order. The original array should not be modified.
Here are also explanations for public test cases:
- input: |
    []
  output: |
    []
  explanation: |
    The input array is empty, so the output remains empty as well.

- input: |
    [5]
  output: |
    [5]
  explanation: |
    The sum of the first and last elements is odd (5), so the array remains the same as it is already sorted in ascending order.

- input: |
    [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]
  output: |
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  explanation: |
    The sum of the first and last elements is even (2 + 5 = 7), so the array is sorted in descending order.

- input: |
    [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]
  output: |
    [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
  explanation: |
    The sum of the first and last elements is odd (2 + 6 = 8), so the array is sorted in ascending order.

Provide up to 3 possible solution plans to the problem.
Each solution plan should:
1.Have a descriptive name.
2.Outline the solution approach:
   - For simple problems (e.g., reversing a list), provide a concise solution (e.g., we can directly use list1[::-1] to do it.).
   - For complex problems (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph), provide a problem-solving plan with high-level steps (e.g., we can use BFS to solve it. First, Initialize a queue with... Second, ...).
  If necessary, select an appropriate algorithm through problem analysis such as brute force, simulation, greedy, hash map, two pointers, DFS/BFS, stack/queue, DP, etc.
3.Ensure functional correctness by addressing all possible valid inputs and edge cases per problem description.

Your answer should be directly parsable as YAML. DO NOT output anything else.
The output must be a YAML object like this:
